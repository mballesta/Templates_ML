# Templates_ML
This repository aims to get general templates of the supervised ML process using Python for tabular data:
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature Engineering
* Model Training and Evaluation

(1) In the EDA, there can be found useful chunks of code to explore and visualize the data. There is also different procedures for outliers and missing values treatment. Categorical and date features are also taken into account.

(2) On the Feature Engineering, some chunks of code on the most usual transformations of the data can be found, but also treatment for unbalanced data

(3) For model training we can find different basic and ensembled supervised methods as expected but also some methods for tunning as grid search. In addition, we review different most common evaluation metrics.
